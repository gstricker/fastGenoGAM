\title{Compute significance for given regions}
\usage{
computeRegionSignificance(fit, regions, smooth = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A GenoGAM object containing the fit}

\item{regions}{A GRanges object of regions of interest}

\item{smooth}{Which fit should be used. The names should be equivalent to the column names
of the object. Lookup with \code{colnames(my_GenoGAM_object)}}
}
\value{
The GRanges object from the 'region' parameter extended by two
columns: pvalue and FDR
}
\description{
For a given set of regions, region-wise pvalues and FDR is computed
}
\details{
For a given set of regions, region-wise pvalues are computed by applying
familywise hochberg correction and taking the minimal p-value. FDR is computed by further
applying Benjamini-Hochberg correction.
