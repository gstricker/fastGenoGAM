\title{fastGenoGAM: A package providing a framework to analyse ChIP-Seq data}
\description{
This package allows statistical analysis of genome-wide
    data with smooth functions using generalized additive models
    based on the implementation from the R-package 'mgcv'. It
    provides methods for the statistical analysis of ChIP-Seq data
    including inference of protein occupancy, and pointwise and
    region-wise differential analysis. Estimation of dispersion and
    smoothing parameters is performed by cross-validation. Scaling
    of generalized additive model fitting to whole chromosomes is
    achieved by parallelization over overlapping genomic intervals.
